            Mexico showcases towns where modernization goes in hand with old time
            customs. Small towns that offer a unique contrast that can delight local visitors and travelers
            from abroad. Uruapan city, well known as The World’s Avocado and Guacamole Capital city, is
            a fine example of this blend. There are three reasons to consider visiting Uruapan city in your
            next vacations: unique gastronomy, outstanding markets to visit and great cultural-religious
            festivals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Uruapan shares some of the gastronomy culture and international recognition that makes
            Morelia, capital city of the state, an international point of reference in terms of cuisine. An
            example of the intense and varied dishes served in Uruapan is Guacamole; Uruapan boasts the
            world’s 1st rank in avocado production, making this exotic fruit both available year-round and
            of the finest quality. The Uruapan guacamole experience is a unique and peerless one. Ice
            creams and ice bars turn to be another Uruapanse “don’t-miss-it” eatery. From sweet and
            creamy macadamia ice-creams to bitter-sour blackberry ice-bars, in this town you can find an
            exclusive variety of exotic ingredients. Entrenched competition among ice-cream producers
            makes it advantageous for visitors to engulf in this little pleasure. Finally, a great variety of
            tamales, corundas and uchepos can be found in Uruapan city. Corundas are normally not
            stuffed, pyramid shaped and salty small cakes. Uchepos are pretty soft and sweet. In contrast
            with traditional tamales which are made from corn flour, these are not stuffed and made of
            pure and fresh smashed corn.

          <p>
            In Uruapan City there are many markets where fresh and high quality local produce can be
            found all week. In La Charanda and San Francisco, the two best known, you can find the most
            exotic and the biggest variety of produce. Walking through the aisles of these markets gives a
            sense of living part of the real Mexican culture, barely known by visitors from abroad and
            highly experiential. If you prefer open spaces and green areas, Uruapan City is a great choice.
            The city has traditional places such as National Park, La Presa (The dam) and La Pinera, as well
            as newly created areas such as various new neighborhood parks known as Parques lineales.

            Uruapan city organizes some of the greatest cultural, religious and artistic festivals in Mexico.
            Such as the pottery festival “Tianguis Artesanal Domingo de Ramos” (also known as Mercado
            de las Ollitas). This is the time and place where local artisans display their art, and visitors can
            find the anything from the cheapest and smallest piece of pottery, to the most elaborate and
            pricy ones. It’s an excellent occasion for making contact with original creative craftsmen.
            Another festival that has been growing year after year is Día de Muertos (Mexican holiday
            celebrating the death, when Mexicans show their devotion to passed away family members).
            In November 2 nd and 3 rd , Uruapan city organizes shrine competitions, tours around the
            graveyard and a respectable variety of artistic shows.
